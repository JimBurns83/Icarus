# tasks file for ssh_config
- name: Check Config Exists
  stat:
      path: "~{{ansible_env.sudo_user}}/.ssh/config" # required. The full path of the file/object to get the facts of.
      #get_checksum: yes # not required. Whether to return a checksum of the file (default sha1).
      #follow: no # not required. Whether to follow symlinks.
      #checksum_algorithm: md5 # not required. choices: md5;sha1;sha224;sha256;sha384;sha512. Algorithm to determine checksum of file. Will throw an error if the host is unable to use specified algorithm.,The remote host has to support the hashing method specified, C(md5) can be unavailable if the host is FIPS-140 compliant.
      #get_mime: yes # not required. Use file magic and return data about the nature of the file. this uses the 'file' utility found on most Linux/Unix systems.,This will add both `mime_type` and 'charset' fields to the return, if possible.,In 2.3 this option changed from 'mime' to 'get_mime' and the default changed to 'Yes'.
      #get_md5: no # not required. Whether to return the md5 sum of the file.,Will return None if not a regular file or if we're unable to use md5 (Common for FIPS-140 compliant systems).,The default of this option changed from C(yes) to C(no) in Ansible 2.5 and will be removed altogether in Ansible 2.9.,Use C(get_checksum=true) with C(checksum_algorithm=md5) to return an md5 hash under the C(checksum) return value.
      #get_attributes: yes # not required. Get file attributes using lsattr tool if present.
  register: config_file
- name: Create Config if not exist
  copy:
      dest: "~{{ansible_env.sudo_user}}/.ssh/config" # required. Remote absolute path where the file should be copied to. If I(src) is a directory, this must be a directory too. If I(dest) is a nonexistent path and if either I(dest) ends with "/" or I(src) is a directory, I(dest) is created. If I(src) and I(dest) are files, the parent directory of I(dest) isn't created: the task fails if it doesn't already exist.
      #src: undefined # not required. Local path to a file to copy to the remote server; can be absolute or relative. If path is a directory, it is copied recursively. In this case, if path ends with "/", only inside contents of that directory are copied to destination. Otherwise, if it does not end with "/", the directory itself with all contents is copied. This behavior is similar to Rsync.
      #directory_mode: undefined # not required. When doing a recursive copy set the mode for the directories. If this is not set we will use the system defaults. The mode is only set on directories which are newly created, and will not affect those that already existed.
      #force: yes # not required. the default is C(yes), which will replace the remote file when contents are different than the source. If C(no), the file will only be transferred if the destination does not exist.
      #remote_src: no # not required. If C(no), it will search for I(src) at originating/master machine.,If C(yes) it will go to the remote/target machine for the I(src). Default is C(no).,Currently I(remote_src) does not support recursive copying.,I(remote_src) only works with C(mode=preserve) as of version 2.6.
      #checksum: undefined # not required. SHA1 checksum of the file being transferred. Used to validate that the copy of the file was successful.,If this is not provided, ansible will use the local calculated checksum of the src file.
      #seuser: undefined # not required. User part of SELinux file context. Will default to system policy, if applicable. If set to C(_default), it will use the C(user) portion of the policy if available.
      #decrypt: yes # not required. This option controls the autodecryption of source files using vault.
      #setype: undefined # not required. Type part of SELinux file context, C(_default) feature works as for I(seuser).
      #group: undefined # not required. Name of the group that should own the file/directory, as would be fed to I(chown).
      content: "Include ~/.ssh/conf.d/*" # not required. When used instead of I(src), sets the contents of a file directly to the specified value. For anything advanced or with formatting also look at the template module.
      #unsafe_writes: no # not required. By default this module uses atomic operations to prevent data corruption or inconsistent reads from the target files, but sometimes systems are configured or just broken in ways that prevent this. One example is docker mounted files, which cannot be updated atomically from inside the container and can only be written in an unsafe manner.,This option allows Ansible to fall back to unsafe methods of updating files when atomic operations fail (however, it doesn't force Ansible to perform unsafe writes). IMPORTANT! Unsafe writes are subject to race conditions and can lead to data corruption.
      #serole: undefined # not required. Role part of SELinux file context, C(_default) feature works as for I(seuser).
      #mode: undefined # not required. Mode the file or directory should be. For those used to I(/usr/bin/chmod) remember that modes are actually octal numbers. You must either add a leading zero so that Ansible's YAML parser knows it is an octal number (like C(0644) or C(01777)) or quote it (like C('644') or C('1777')) so Ansible receives a string and can do its own conversion from string into number.  Giving Ansible a number without following one of these rules will end up with a decimal number which will have unexpected results.  As of version 1.8, the mode may be specified as a symbolic mode (for example, C(u+rwx) or C(u=rw,g=r,o=r)).  As of version 2.3, the mode may also be the special string C(preserve).  C(preserve) means that the file will be given the same permissions as the source file.
      #selevel: s0 # not required. Level part of the SELinux file context. This is the MLS/MCS attribute, sometimes known as the C(range). C(_default) feature works as for I(seuser).
      #owner: undefined # not required. Name of the user that should own the file/directory, as would be fed to I(chown).
      #follow: no # not required. This flag indicates that filesystem links in the destination, if they exist, should be followed.
      #validate: undefined # not required. The validation command to run before copying into place. The path to the file to validate is passed in via '%s' which must be present as in the example below. The command is passed securely so shell features like expansion and pipes won't work.
      #attributes: undefined # not required. Attributes the file or directory should have. To get supported flags look at the man page for I(chattr) on the target system. This string should contain the attributes in the same order as the one displayed by I(lsattr).,C(=) operator is assumed as default, otherwise C(+) or C(-) operators need to be included in the string.
      #backup: no # not required. Create a backup file including the timestamp information so you can get the original file back if you somehow clobbered it incorrectly.
      #local_follow: yes # not required. This flag indicates that filesystem links in the source tree, if they exist, should be followed.
  when: config_file.stat.exists == false
- name: ensure conf.d exists
  file:
      path: "~{{ansible_env.sudo_user}}/.ssh/conf.d/" # required. Path to the file being managed.
      #src: undefined # not required. path of the file to link to (applies only to C(state=link) and C(state=hard)). Will accept absolute, relative and nonexisting paths. Relative paths are relative to the file being created (C(path)) which is how the UNIX command C(ln -s SRC DEST) treats relative paths.
      #selevel: s0 # not required. Level part of the SELinux file context. This is the MLS/MCS attribute, sometimes known as the C(range). C(_default) feature works as for I(seuser).
      #force: no # not required. force the creation of the symlinks in two cases: the source file does not exist (but will appear later); the destination exists and is a file (so, we need to unlink the "path" file and create symlink to the "src" file in place of it).
      #unsafe_writes: no # not required. By default this module uses atomic operations to prevent data corruption or inconsistent reads from the target files, but sometimes systems are configured or just broken in ways that prevent this. One example is docker mounted files, which cannot be updated atomically from inside the container and can only be written in an unsafe manner.,This option allows Ansible to fall back to unsafe methods of updating files when atomic operations fail (however, it doesn't force Ansible to perform unsafe writes). IMPORTANT! Unsafe writes are subject to race conditions and can lead to data corruption.
      #access_time: undefined # not required. This parameter indicates the time the file's access time should be set to,Should be C(preserve) when no modification is required, C(YYYYMMDDHHMM.SS) when using default time format, or C(now),Default is None meaning that C(preserve) is the default for C(state=[file,directory,link,hard]) and C(now) is default for C(state=touch)
      #seuser: undefined # not required. User part of SELinux file context. Will default to system policy, if applicable. If set to C(_default), it will use the C(user) portion of the policy if available.
      #recurse: no # not required. recursively set the specified file attributes (applies only to directories)
      #serole: undefined # not required. Role part of SELinux file context, C(_default) feature works as for I(seuser).
      #access_time_format: %Y%m%d%H%M.%S # not required. When used with C(access_time), indicates the time format that must be used.,Based on default Python format (see time.strftime doc)
      #group: undefined # not required. Name of the group that should own the file/directory, as would be fed to I(chown).
      #modification_time: undefined # not required. This parameter indicates the time the file's modification time should be set to,Should be C(preserve) when no modification is required, C(YYYYMMDDHHMM.SS) when using default time format, or C(now),Default is None meaning that C(preserve) is the default for C(state=[file,directory,link,hard]) and C(now) is default for C(state=touch)
      state: directory # not required. choices: absent;directory;file;hard;link;touch. If C(directory), all intermediate subdirectories will be created if they do not exist. Since Ansible 1.7 they will be created with the supplied permissions. If C(file), the file will NOT be created if it does not exist; see the C(touch) value or the M(copy) or M(template) module if you want that behavior.  If C(link), the symbolic link will be created or changed. Use C(hard) for hardlinks. If C(absent), directories will be recursively deleted, and files or symlinks will be unlinked. Note that C(absent) will not cause C(file) to fail if the C(path) does not exist as the state did not change. If C(touch) (new in 1.4), an empty file will be created if the C(path) does not exist, while an existing file or directory will receive updated file access and modification times (similar to the way `touch` works from the command line).
      #mode: undefined # not required. Mode the file or directory should be. For those used to I(/usr/bin/chmod) remember that modes are actually octal numbers. You must either add a leading zero so that Ansible's YAML parser knows it is an octal number (like C(0644) or C(01777)) or quote it (like C('644') or C('1777')) so Ansible receives a string and can do its own conversion from string into number.

      #modification_time_format: %Y%m%d%H%M.%S # not required. When used with C(modification_time), indicates the time format that must be used.,Based on default Python format (see time.strftime doc)
      #owner: undefined # not required. Name of the user that should own the file/directory, as would be fed to I(chown).
      #follow: yes # not required. This flag indicates that filesystem links, if they exist, should be followed.,Previous to Ansible 2.5, this was C(no) by default.
      #attributes: undefined # not required. Attributes the file or directory should have. To get supported flags look at the man page for I(chattr) on the target system. This string should contain the attributes in the same order as the one displayed by I(lsattr).,C(=) operator is assumed as default, otherwise C(+) or C(-) operators need to be included in the string.
      #setype: undefined # not required. Type part of SELinux file context, C(_default) feature works as for I(seuser).
- name: "Copy Github SSH Config file"
  copy:
      dest: "~{{ansible_env.sudo_user}}/.ssh/conf.d/github" # required. Remote absolute path where the file should be copied to. If I(src) is a directory, this must be a directory too. If I(dest) is a nonexistent path and if either I(dest) ends with "/" or I(src) is a directory, I(dest) is created. If I(src) and I(dest) are files, the parent directory of I(dest) isn't created: the task fails if it doesn't already exist.
